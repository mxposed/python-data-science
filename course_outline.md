# Lecture 1. Python as a programming language
1. Computing is numbers in memory
2. Python is a language
  * sentences (statements)
  * parts of speech
  * hierarchy (AST)
3. Parts of speech, aka data types
  1. Simple
    * numbers
    * strings
    * boolean values
    * Nona
  2. Complex
    * tuples
    * lists
    * dictionaries
4. Python expressions
  1. References
    * variable
    * attribute of an object
    * calling a function
    * calling a method
  2. Subscripts
    * indexing with numbers
    * indexing with strings
    * indexing with slices
  3. Operators
    * mathematical expressions
    * logical expressions
    * comparisons
5. Python statements
  * assignment
  * conditions
  * loops
  * errors
  * imports
  * function definitions
6. Common python errors
7. Python data structures
  * lists
  * dictionaries
8. Miscellaneous
  * other people's code
  * common packages
  * github

# Lecture 2. Pandas: structure and how to access data
1. Python recap
  * important expressions
  * lists and dictionaries
2. Python classes
  * data and behaviour together
3. Working with jupyter notebooks
4. Pandas data structure
  * table with rows and columns
  * `index` attribute for row names
  * `columns` attribute for column names
  * `shape` for dimensions
  * column index is the same as table index
5. Selecting elements from Series
  * by labels (index, row names) with `loc`
  * by position with `iloc`
  * by filtering criteria (boolean index)
6. Selecting elements from DataFrame
  * same ways as above
7. Tips
  * `sort_values` on Series to sort that column
  * `str.len()` to get number of characters in string for each value in a Series
  * `str.startswith(x)` to test if each value starts with string `x`
  * `str.contains(x)` to test if each value contrains string `x`

# Lecture 3. Pandas: values, overview functions
1. Pandas dtypes
  * different data in different columns
  * different operations for data
2. Overview methods
  * for string/categorical types
  * for number types
